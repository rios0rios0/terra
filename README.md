# Terra

## Introduction
Welcome to `terra` â€“ a powerful wrapper for Terragrunt and Terraform that revolutionizes infrastructure as code management.
Inspired by the simplicity and efficiency of Kubernetes, `terra` allows you to apply Terraform code with the ease of specifying paths directly in your commands.
Our motivation: "Have you ever wondered about applying Terraform code like Kubernetes? Typing the path to be applied after the command you want to use?"

## Features
- Seamless integration with Terraform and Terragrunt.
- Intuitive command-line interface.
- Enhanced state management.
- Simplified module path specification.
- Cross-platform compatibility.
- Auto-answering for Terragrunt prompts to avoid manual intervention.
- Self-update capability to automatically update terra to the latest version.
- Version checking for Terra, Terraform, and Terragrunt dependencies.
- Automatic dependency installation and management.
- Support for AWS and Azure cloud provider switching.

## Installation
To install `terra`, you can build it from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rios0rios0/terra.git
cd terra
make install
```

Or download pre-built binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/rios0rios0/terra/releases).

After installation, you can install Terraform and Terragrunt dependencies automatically:
```bash
terra install
```

To update terra itself to the latest version:
```bash
terra self-update
```

## Usage
Here's how to use `terra` with Terraform/Terragrunt:
```bash
# it's going to apply all subdirectories inside "path"
terra run-all apply /path

# it's going to plan all subdirectories inside "to"
terra run-all plan /path/to

# it's going to plan just the "module" subdirectory inside "to"
terra run-all plan /path/to/module

# or using Terraform approach, plan just the "module" subdirectory inside "to"
terra plan /path/to/module

# with auto-answering to avoid manual prompts (answers "n" to external dependency prompts)
terra --auto-answer run-all apply /path
terra -a run-all plan /path/to
```

The commands available are:
```bash
clear       Clear all cache and modules directories
format      Format all files in the current directory
install     Install or update Terraform and Terragrunt to the latest versions
update      Install or update Terraform and Terragrunt to the latest versions (alias for install)
self-update Update terra to the latest version
version     Show Terra, Terraform, and Terragrunt versions
```

### Auto-Answer Feature

The `--auto-answer` (or `-a`) flag enables automatic responses to Terragrunt prompts, eliminating the need for manual intervention during long-running operations. This is particularly useful in CI/CD pipelines or when running multiple Terragrunt commands.

**What it does:**
- Automatically answers "n" to external dependency prompts
- Automatically answers "n" to general yes/no prompts
- Switches to manual mode for confirmation prompts (like "Are you sure you want to run...")
- Filters out the auto-answer flag before passing arguments to Terragrunt

**Example:**
```bash
# Without auto-answer - requires manual input for each prompt
terra run-all apply /path

# With auto-answer - automatically handles most prompts
terra --auto-answer run-all apply /path
```

### Version Management

#### Checking Versions
Use the `version` command to check Terra, Terraform, and Terragrunt versions:
```bash
terra version
```
This displays:
- Terra version (current version installed)
- Terraform version (if installed, otherwise "not installed")
- Terragrunt version (if installed, otherwise "not installed")

#### Self-Update
Keep terra up to date with the `self-update` command:
```bash
# Interactive update (prompts for confirmation)
terra self-update

# Force update without prompts
terra self-update --force

# Dry run to see what would be updated
terra self-update --dry-run
```

#### Dependency Management
Install or update Terraform and Terragrunt dependencies:
```bash
# Install dependencies (prompts for updates if newer versions available)
terra install

# Alternative command (alias for install)
terra update
```

## Environment Configuration

Terra can be configured with environment variables for cloud provider integration. Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# Optional: Cloud provider (if specified, must be "aws" or "azure")
TERRA_CLOUD=aws

# AWS specific (required for role switching when using AWS)
TERRA_AWS_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/terraform-role

# Azure specific (required for subscription switching when using Azure)  
TERRA_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

# Optional: Terraform workspace
TERRA_WORKSPACE=dev

# Optional: Terraform variables (any TF_VAR_* variables)
TF_VAR_environment=development
TF_VAR_region=us-west-2
```

**Note**: If `TERRA_CLOUD` is specified, it must be set to either "aws" or "azure". This enables cloud-specific features like role switching for AWS or subscription switching for Azure.

If you have some input variables, you can use environment variables (`.env`) with the prefix `TF_VAR_`:
```bash
# .env example for Terraform variables
TF_VAR_foo=bar

# command (that depends on the environment variable called "foo")
terra run-all apply /path/to/module
```

- [Terragrunt documentation](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/inputs/).

## Known Issues
1. Notice that Windows has `path` size limitations (256 characters).
   If you are using WSL interoperability (calling `.exe` files inside WSL), you could have errors like this:
   ```bash
   /mnt/c/WINDOWS/system32/notepad.exe: Invalid argument
   ```
   That means, you exceeded the `path` size limitation on the current `path` you are running the command.
   To avoid this issue, move your infrastructure project to a shorter `path`. Closer to your "/home" directory, for example.
