# Terra

## Introduction
Welcome to `terra` â€“ a powerful wrapper for Terragrunt and Terraform that revolutionizes infrastructure as code management. Inspired by the simplicity and efficiency of Kubernetes,
`terra` allows you to apply Terraform code with the ease of specifying paths directly in your commands. Our motivation: "Have you ever wondered about applying Terraform code like Kubernetes?
Typing the path to be applied after the command you want to use?"

## Features
- Seamless integration with Terraform and Terragrunt.
- Intuitive command-line interface.
- Enhanced state management.
- Simplified module path specification.
- Cross-platform compatibility.

## Installation
To install `terra`, ensure you have Terraform and Terragrunt installed on your system. Then run the following command:
```bash
# Replace with the actual installation command for `terra`
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terra.git
cd terra
./install.sh
```

## Usage
Here's how to use `terra`:

```bash
# Applying a specific Terraform module
terra apply /path/to/module

# Destroying a module
terra destroy /path/to/module

# Plan a module
terra plan /path/to/module
```
