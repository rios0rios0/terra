# Terra

## Introduction
Welcome to `terra` â€“ a powerful wrapper for Terragrunt and Terraform that revolutionizes infrastructure as code management.
Inspired by the simplicity and efficiency of Kubernetes, `terra` allows you to apply Terraform code with the ease of specifying paths directly in your commands.
Our motivation: "Have you ever wondered about applying Terraform code like Kubernetes? Typing the path to be applied after the command you want to use?"

## Features
- Seamless integration with Terraform and Terragrunt.
- Intuitive command-line interface.
- Enhanced state management.
- Simplified module path specification.
- Cross-platform compatibility.
- Auto-answering for Terragrunt prompts to avoid manual intervention.

## Installation
To install `terra`, ensure you have Terraform and Terragrunt installed on your system
(you don't need, we install for you with `terra install`!!), then run the following command:
```bash
# Replace with the actual installation command for `terra`
git clone https://github.com/rios0rios0/terra.git
cd terra
make install
```

## Usage
Here's how to use `terra` with Terraform/Terragrunt:
```bash
# it's going to apply all subdirectories inside "path"
terra run-all apply /path

# it's going to plan all subdirectories inside "to"
terra run-all plan /path/to

# it's going to plan just the "module" subdirectory inside "to"
terra run-all plan /path/to/module

# or using Terraform approach, plan just the "module" subdirectory inside "to"
terra plan /path/to/module

# with auto-answering to avoid manual prompts (answers "n" to external dependency prompts)
terra --auto-answer run-all apply /path
terra -a run-all plan /path/to
```

The commands available are:
```bash
clear       Clear all cache and modules directories
fmt         Format all files in the current directory
install     Install Terraform and Terragrunt (they are pre-requisites)
```

### Auto-Answer Feature

The `--auto-answer` (or `-a`) flag enables automatic responses to Terragrunt prompts, eliminating the need for manual intervention during long-running operations. This is particularly useful in CI/CD pipelines or when running multiple Terragrunt commands.

**What it does:**
- Automatically answers "n" to external dependency prompts
- Automatically answers "n" to general yes/no prompts
- Switches to manual mode for confirmation prompts (like "Are you sure you want to run...")
- Filters out the auto-answer flag before passing arguments to Terragrunt

**Example:**
```bash
# Without auto-answer - requires manual input for each prompt
terra run-all apply /path

# With auto-answer - automatically handles most prompts
terra --auto-answer run-all apply /path
```

If you have some input variables, you can use environment variables (`.env`) with the prefix `TF_VAR_`:
```bash
# .env
TF_VAR_foo=bar


# command (that depends on the environment variable called "foo")
terra run-all apply /path /path/to/module
```

- [Terragrunt documentation](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/inputs/).

## Known Issues
1. Notice that Windows has `path` size limitations (256 characters).
   If you are using WSL interoperability (calling `.exe` files inside WSL), you could have errors like this:
   ```bash
   /mnt/c/WINDOWS/system32/notepad.exe: Invalid argument
   ```
   That means, you exceeded the `path` size limitation on the current `path` you are running the command.
   To avoid this issue, move your infrastructure project to a shorter `path`. Closer to your "/home" directory, for example.
